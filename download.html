<h3>Official Releases</h3>
<p>
  As yet there are no official releases or tags, but the git repository can
  be considered to be more or less the official version.
</p>

<h3>Obtaining the software</h3>
<p>
  Source code is now under GIT version control and is hosted online at
  github. There are many ways to access, browse, clone or download the
  codebase, including methods for directly downloading .tar.gz or .zip
  archives for people who do not wish to install (or can't use) git clients
  internally.
