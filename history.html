<h3>History</h3>
<p>
  This is the 4th rewrite of a project that began in mid-2005.
</p>
<p>
  Early versions of this program used
  <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c">Xalan-C++</a>,
  but that package and its dependencies turned out to be difficult
  to build on various Linux and Apple OS X systems. Since a design
  goal for this tool was easy installation across different
  hardware platforms and architectures, alternatives to the C++
  XSLT engines were investigated.
</p>
<p>
  The 2nd generation xml-qstat programs and CGIs used the very
  nice Perl modules <b>XML::LibXML</b> and <b>XML::LibXSLT</b>.
  Those modules provided Perl interfaces to the Gnome Project's
  excellent <b><a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org">libxml2</a></b> and
  <b><a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT">libxslt</a></b> code libraries.
</p>
<p>
  The 2nd generation code was abandoned when <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/">Apache Cocoon</a>
  was discovered &ndash; the Cocoon framework functions out of the
  box on just about any Java-enabled system and there are no
  requirements to download and build various dependent XML
  libraries and Perl modules. The XML-based publishing framework
  provided by Cocoon provides additional features and capabilities
  not found in standalone XSLT transformation engines.
</p>
<p>
  The 3rd generation of xml-qstat came after Chris Dagdigian
  effectively abandoned the project and codebase for quite some
  time as his work took him in different directions. During this
  period, Mark Olesen made very significant improvements both in
  cleaning up the XSLT framework as well as adding entirely new
  features such as support for multiple clusters.
</p>
<p>
  Generation 4 of this project is essentially Mark Olesen's fork,
  uploaded and imported into a new GIT repository hosted at
  <a href="http://github.com">github</a>.
  We plan to use the new git repository as the base for the
  long-delayed 1.0 release. Chris Dagdigian is back as a
  contributor and the project is seeking new contributors, testers
  and developers.
