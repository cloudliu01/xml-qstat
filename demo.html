<h3>Demo Sites</h3>
<p>
  This list will grow and shrink over time. Some versions of Grid
  Engine 6.x produce invalid XML in response to cluster job error
  states. This invalid XML will will break the XML transformation
  resulting in an ugly Cocoon Application error being displayed.
  These bugs have all been fixed in the current Grid Engine
  codebase.

<h3>Server-Side Rendering Demo</h3>
<p>
  This site will be running off the GitHub repository so it should
  reflect the latest features, bug fixes and capabilities:<br/>
  <a href="http://xml-qstat.org/xmlqstat/">http://xml-qstat.org/xmlqstat/</a>
</p>

<h3>Client-Side Rendering Demo</h3>
<p>
  With client-side XSLT transformations, the webserver process becomes
  trivial. Here is an example with serving cached files from
  <b><a href="xmlqstat/cluster.xml">this website</a></b>.
  Note that obviously not all the features are available since the file
  contents are static.
</p>
<p>
  The <b><a href="xmlqstat/test.xml">test page</a></b> can help you
  determine if your browser handles XSLT properly, with or without JavaScript.
