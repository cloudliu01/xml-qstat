<h3>About this software</h3>
<p>
  <b>xml-qstat</b> is an attempt to do something useful with the XML status
  information that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_Engine">Grid Engine</a> produces.
  At its heart, it comprises a collection of XSLT stylesheets that can be
  used with render Grid Engine XML into a variety of output formats (eg,
  XHTML, RSS).
</p>
<p>
  The current development efforts have be applied to reducing the
  installation size and to improving the flexiblity. The goal is to have an
  application that can be readily installed and run on even the weakest
  cluster headnodes.
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  The <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a> and
  <a href="demo.html">demo</a> pages will give a better view
  of the current capabilities.

  Whether as as server-side XSLT transformations, <b>xml-qstat</b> contains a set of
  files and folders designed to function as a self-contained web application within the
  <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1">Apache Cocoon 2.1</a>
  XML publishing framework.
  For client-side XSLT transformations, <b>xml-qstat</b> uses modules added
  into the <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/httpi/">HTTPi webserver</a>
  to deliver appropriate xml+xsl to the client browser.

  Most of the work involved in developing this package centers on creating
  and improving the XSL stylesheets that guide the transformation of Grid
  Engine XML into various desired output formats. Quite a bit of effort has
  also gone into the various JavaScript, CSS stylesheets and other "web design"
  elements (although more work can always done).

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
  <b>Multi-cluster support</b> &ndash;
  Display data from multiple Grid Engine clusters
</li>
<li>
  <b>flex-grid (qlicserver) integration</b> &ndash;
  allow dynamic display of license/resource utilization
  in combination with the
  <a href="http://wiki.gridengine.info/wiki/index.php/Olesen-FLEXlm-Integration">flex-grid
  qlicserver package</a>
</li>
<li>
  <b>Cached Display Mode</b> &ndash;
  XML status data is from Grid Engine is cached to a local file at a user
  definable interval and used for generating web pages. This mode prevents
  the SGE 'qmaster' daemon from having to be contacted with a qstat query
  each time a page is accessed. Most suitable for sites operating very large
  clusters or systems with many thousands of active jobs. Information about
  individual jobs is still fetched dynamically
</li>
<li><b>Live Display Mode</b> &ndash;
  Grid Engine state and status data is refreshed before every page display
  by builtin methods that query the SGE qmaster directly. Suitable for sites
  and clusters where generating a 'qstat' call each time a page is accessed
  does not present scaling or performance issues
</li>
<li>
  <b>Client-side XSLT transformations</b> &ndash;
  using the HTTPi webserver
</li>
<li>
  <b>Server-side XSLT transformations</b> &ndash;
  using Apache Cocoon 2.1
</li>
<li>
  <b>Per user job sorting</b> &ndash; users can view their own
  pending/active jobs simply by surfing to a simple URL.
</li>
<li>
  Job Detail handling via URL for any active or pending job.
</li>
<li>
  Primary view can be rendered in "standard" ('show me everything') mode or
  a special "terse" ('summary') view can be used for very large or very
  active clusters. This is to handle clusters with thousands of nodes or
  hundreds of thousands of active grid jobs
</li>
</ul>
