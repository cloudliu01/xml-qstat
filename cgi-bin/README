Development version of xml-qstat as pure CGI application.

- appears okay, but needs more testing


- For Apache, can use this type of setup:

# /etc/apache2/conf.d/xmlqstat.conf

ScriptAlias /grid "/export/home/mark/xml-qstat/cgi-bin/grid.cgi"
<Location /grid>
   Options +ExecCGI
   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all
</Location>
