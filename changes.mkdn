### Release Candidate (2009-11-16)

- HTTPi-1.6.2 is now released
- Prompt user for GridEngine arch at configuration time
- Try harder to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or equivalent) for systems that
  need it.
- Add 'free' and 'warn' views for 'qstat -f' output
- Changed the cluster text summary to 'report'
- Provision for a future 'summary' view for 'qstat -f' output.
  Should be similar in functionality to the existing 'qhost' summary.
- Eliminated /xmlqstat/cluster in favour of simply /xmlqstat/
- Removed the restriction of needing */xmlqstat* as the resource URI.
- Use */grid/* as the default resource URI instead of */xmlqstat*. This is
  admittedly poor marketing, but requires fewer letters and fits better with
  end-user expectations for GridEngine monitoring.
- Tightened security on the jobinfo cgi script used in the cocoon
  implementation.
