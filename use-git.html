<h3>Starting with git</h3>

Go to a clean starting place (eg, your home directory):
<pre>
$ cd $HOME
</pre>

Clone the repository without checking out anything just yet and we'll also
specify 'github' as the name of the remote repository that we'll be tracking:
<pre>
$ git clone --no-checkout --origin github http://github.com/bioteam/xml-qstat.git
</pre>

We now change to the newly created directory:
<pre>
$ cd xml-qstat/
</pre>

Since we haven't checked out any files, the only thing in the directory
will be the <b>.git/</b> hidden directory:
<pre>
$ ls -a
./  ../  .git/
</pre>

Listing all of the git branches should look like this ('<b>*</b>';
indicates the currently active branch):
<pre>
$ git branch -l -a
* master
  github/HEAD
  github/master
</pre>


Now we are ready to start our own branch, which we'll
setup <b>without tracking</b> the remote branch.
<u>This is an important point.</u>
By creating a non-tracked branch, we can avoid worrying about clobbering any
of our custom settings with future updates.
<pre>
$ git checkout --no-track -b site github/master
</pre>

For general cleanliness, we'll also remove the tracked branch <em>master</em>,
but it can always be reinstated later if desired:
<pre>
$ git branch -d master
Deleted branch master.
</pre>

We can now check that everything is as it should be:
<pre>
$ git status
# On branch site
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
</pre>

Since we are on our own branch (<em>site</em>), we can make changes
independent of the upstream branches (<em>github/master</em>).

<p>
The first thing we'll do is adjust the paths to suit our installation.
Depending upon your final configuration, you may not need to adjust all
of the following files:
</p>
<pre>
  make-xmlqstat-jar.sh
  init-scripts/cocoon
  init-scripts/httpi
  init-scripts/xmlqstat-cacher
  scripts/jobinfo
  scripts/xmlqstat-cacher.pl
</pre>

You should also adjust the <b>xmlqstat/config/config.xml</b> to
reflect your site (perhaps with your own logo image).
If you are using the FlexLM integration (qlicserver), you should also
symlink the cache directories at this time under
<b>xmlqstat/cache-{clusterName}</b>.

<p>
To preserve these initial editing changes thus far,
some of the following commands will be useful.
</p>
<dl style="margin-left: 2em">
  <dt>git status</dt>

  <dd>check the current of things</dd>
  <dt>git add -u</dt>
  <dd>stage updated files for the next commit</dd>
  <dt>git add file1 .. fileN</dt>
  <dd>stage new files for the next commit</dd>
  <dt>git commit</dt>

  <dd>commit the changes</dd>
  <dt>git commit --amend</dt>
  <dd>amend to the previous commit</dd>
  <dt>git log</dt>
  <dd>view the commit log</dd>
</dl>

At any time we can also fetch the newest version, without affecting our
working directory whatsoever:
<dl style="margin-left: 2em">
  <dt>git fetch github</dt>
  <dd>fetch the lastest version</dd>
  <dt>git log --stat --no-merges github/master ^HEAD</dt>
  <dd>view the changes in github/master but not in our branch</dd>
</dl>

Provided that our working directory is clean (no uncommitted changes),
we can merge in any upstream changes:
<pre>
$ git merge github/master
</pre>

This normally merges without problems, except when you have changed exactly
the same lines as have been changed in the <em>github/master</em>.
You'll need to resolve such conflicts by hand (git can't really tell who
should be right in this situation) and commit the finally resolved versions.
